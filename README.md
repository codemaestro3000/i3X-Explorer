# i3X Explorer

The official cross-platform desktop application for browsing and monitoring [I3X](https://www.i3x.dev) (Industrial Information Interface eXchange) API servers. Similar to [MQTT Explorer](https://mqtt-explorer.com/) but for the [I3X protocol](https://www.github.com/cesmii/i3x).

## Features

- Connect to any I3X-compliant server (auto-detects v0, v1-beta, and v1 wire formats)
- Three browse views in one tree:
  - **Namespaces** → Object Types → Object Instances
  - **Objects** (flat list of every instance the server exposes)
  - **Hierarchy** (parent/child structure, with one root per upstream server when fronting a wrapper)
- Inline filter bar pinned at the top of the tree; deep matches surface their ancestor namespaces, types, and hierarchy parents so they stay visible
- Top-level folders auto-expand on search so matches are visible without manual clicks
- Object counts at every level — folders, namespaces, types, and hierarchy nodes
- Authoritative chevron state: branches that have no expandable children don't show a chevron, even when the underlying object claims to be compositional
- View object details, metadata, schema extensions, and current values
- Relationship graph for non-compositional relationships; click any node to navigate directly to it in the tree; hover to see full names
- Subscribe to objects for real-time updates via SSE (with polling fallback) and a trend chart for numeric values; subscriptions auto-recover transparently if the server expires them
- Global object search modal (⌘K / Ctrl+K) that navigates and expands to any match by name or elementId
- Tree auto-refresh: expanding a branch re-fetches from the server; 30s background poll keeps expanded branches current
- Light and dark theme with toggle button (follows OS preference by default)

## Installation

Download the latest release for your platform:

| Platform | Download |
|----------|----------|
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `i3X Explorer-x.x.x-mac-arm64.dmg` |
| macOS (Intel) | `i3X Explorer-x.x.x-mac-x64.dmg` |
| Windows (64-bit) | `i3X Explorer-x.x.x-win-x64.exe` |
| Windows (32-bit) | `i3X Explorer-x.x.x-win-ia32.exe` |
| Windows (Portable) | `i3X Explorer-x.x.x-portable.exe` |
| Linux (x64) | `i3X Explorer-x.x.x-linux-x86_64.AppImage` |
| Linux (ARM64) | `i3X Explorer-x.x.x-linux-arm64.AppImage` |

### Linux AppImage

```bash
chmod +x "i3X Explorer-x.x.x-linux-x86_64.AppImage"
./"i3X Explorer-x.x.x-linux-x86_64.AppImage"
```

**Ubuntu 22.04+ / Debian:** AppImages require FUSE 2, which is not installed by default on newer distributions. If the AppImage fails to launch, install the required library:

```bash
sudo apt install libfuse2
```

Optionally, consider using [AppImageLauncher](https://github.com/TheAssassin/AppImageLauncher) to integrate into your Launcher.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))
- npm

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/cesmii/I3X-Explorer.git
cd I3X-Explorer

# Use correct Node version
nvm use 20

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Generate app icons (requires ImageMagick: brew install imagemagick)
./scripts/generate-icons.sh build/icon-1024.png

# Start Electron app in development mode (with hot reload)
npm run dev
```

### Browser-Only Mode

You can also run just the React UI in a browser without Electron, which is useful for quick testing or development:

```bash
npx vite
```

This starts a Vite dev server at http://localhost:5173/ where you can access the full UI in your browser.

### Build Commands

Note: The best environment to build for all platforms is a modern macOS, however to sign the Windows binaries, you will have to build on Windows.

```bash
# Best way to build (mac/linux/web/all)
./scripts/build-all.sh [mac|win|linux|web|all]

# Manually Build for current platform
npm run build

# Manually Build Platform-specific
npm run build:mac          # macOS (Intel + Apple Silicon)
npm run build:win          # Windows (x64, x86, portable) — unsigned
npm run build:linux        # Linux (AppImage x64 + ARM64)
npm run build:web          # Web (static files → dist-web/)
npm run build:all          # All platforms
```

Build artifacts are output to `release/{version}/`. The web build produces a `i3x-explorer-{version}-web.zip` ready to extract on any static web server.

> **Note:** `build-all.sh win` and `npm run build:win` produce unsigned Windows builds. For signed Windows builds (required to suppress SmartScreen), use the dedicated PowerShell script on a Windows machine — see [Windows Signing](#windows-signing) below.

### Web Deployment

The web build (`./scripts/build-all.sh web`) produces a `dist-web/` directory of static files that can be served by any web server (nginx, Apache, Caddy, S3, etc.).

#### Pre-populating the server list with `config.json`

On first visit (before the user has saved any settings), the app fetches `config.json` from the same directory as `index.html`. You can use this to point users at your server automatically instead of having them type a URL.

Create a `config.json` alongside `index.html` on the web server:

```json
{
  "serverUrl": "https://your-i3x-server.example.com/v1",
  "recentUrls": [
    "https://your-i3x-server.example.com/v1",
    "https://api.i3x.dev/v1"
  ]
}
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `serverUrl` | Pre-fills the Server URL field in the connection dialog |
| `recentUrls` | Pre-populates the Recent Connections list |

`config.json` is only applied on a user's **first visit**. Once they have saved settings in their browser, `config.json` is ignored — their local preferences take priority.

The default `config.json` shipped in `dist-web/` points at `https://api.i3x.dev/v1`. Replace it (or delete it) as needed for your deployment.

#### Deploying from a synced git repo

If your server has the repo cloned and uses `scripts/deploy-web.sh` to build and serve the app, create a `config.local.json` at the root of the repo. The deploy script copies it over `dist-web/config.json` automatically after each build, so it survives rebuilds without being committed to git:

```bash
# On the server, create once:
cat > /home/cesmii/repos/i3X-Explorer/config.local.json <<'EOF'
{
  "serverUrl": "https://your-i3x-server.example.com/v1",
  "recentUrls": ["https://your-i3x-server.example.com/v1"]
}
EOF

# Then rebuild:
sudo systemctl restart i3x-explorer-web
```

### macOS Notarization

To produce notarized macOS builds (required for arm64 downloads to open without a "app is damaged" error), you need an [Apple Developer account](https://developer.apple.com/) and a **Developer ID Application** certificate in your keychain.

1. **Create the certificate** — Xcode → Settings → Accounts → your Apple account → Manage Certificates → `+` → **Developer ID Application**

2. **Create an app-specific password** at [appleid.apple.com](https://appleid.apple.com) → Sign-In and Security → App-Specific Passwords

3. **Find your Team ID** at [developer.apple.com/account](https://developer.apple.com/account) (top-right, 10 characters)

4. **Create `scripts/set-apple-vars.sh`** (this file is git-ignored):

   ```bash
   export APPLE_ID="you@example.com"
   export APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD="xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"
   export APPLE_TEAM_ID="XXXXXXXXXX"
   ```

5. **Build** — `./scripts/build-all.sh mac` will source the file automatically and notarize both Intel and Apple Silicon DMGs.

If `set-apple-vars.sh` is absent or the env vars are unset, the build completes unsigned with a warning.

### Windows Signing

To produce signed Windows builds (which fully suppress the SmartScreen "Unknown publisher" warning), run on a **Windows machine**:

```powershell
.\scripts\build-sign-win.ps1
```

This script builds the app, generates icons, and signs all `.exe` files using **Azure Trusted Signing**. It requires:

- [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php#windows) installed and on PATH
   - `winget install -e --id ImageMagick.ImageMagick` from PowerShell
- [Windows Developer Mode](ms-settings:developers) enabled (or run as Administrator)
- Azure Trusted Signing credentials in `scripts\set-azure-vars.ps1` (git-ignored)
   - See [WINDOWS-SIGNING.md](WINDOWS-SIGNING.md) for full Azure setup instructions.

If you don't have signing set up, unsigned builds still work — users just need to click **More info → Run anyway** in the SmartScreen dialog.

### Updating the Icon

**macOS / Linux** (requires ImageMagick: `brew install imagemagick`):
```bash
./scripts/generate-icons.sh /path/to/your/icon.png
```

**Windows** (requires [ImageMagick for Windows](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php#windows)):
```powershell
.\scripts\generate-icons.ps1 path\to\your\icon.png
```

Both scripts write to `build/` and are called automatically by the respective build scripts. After updating icons, rebuild the app.

## Usage

1. Launch i3X Explorer
2. Enter the server URL (default: `https://api.i3x.dev/v1`)
3. Click **Connect**
4. Browse the tree to explore namespaces, object types, and objects
5. Click any object to view its details and current value
6. Click **Subscribe** on an object to monitor real-time updates
7. Use the bottom panel to manage subscriptions and view live values
